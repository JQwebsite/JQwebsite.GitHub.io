    <h2>The Dry-Brain Effect</h2>
    <p>Dry brain occurs as a result of an individual not drinking enough water. While it is not severe enough to cause cardiac arrest or result in the person being unconcious, it have been known to cause slow processing of data, as a result of the damage in the hippocampus.</p>
    <p>People will sometimes blame this damage as having dry-eyes. However, in the studies conducted on an individual, it is found that their eyes are sufficiently moist. This person suffers from the dry-brain effect, as observations shows that he is frequently late and have problem doing simple conversation of binary bits, as well as factorization</p>

    <p>It is possible to reverse the dry-brain effect by drinking 8 liters of water per day. This will cause reverse osmosis to take place and dilute the brain, to its normal water volume, causing it to be <br><b>Wet, Soggy, Slimy and Squishy</b></p>
