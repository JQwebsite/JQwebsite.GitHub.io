            <p>HydroTrack is a device that helps people track their water intake and stay hydrated. It uses a multi-colored LED ring and connectivity with
            a mobile phone to display useful information and allow users to review historical data. An app was created to interface with the data
            collected by HydroTrack and provide additional features and functionality. The device is designed to be energy efficient, with a long
            battery life and the use of sleep states and BLE technologies to reduce power consumption. By using HydroTrack, users can ensure that they
            are getting enough fluids throughout the day, motivate themselves to drink more water, and understand their own water consumption patterns.</p>

                and I had done research and experiment to understand more on the topic of ionising radiation.

                The E-Ink school calendar display is a personal project that I created, the motivation being: it is more
                convenient when compared to checking my timetable. This project requires me to create intricate program,
                such as retrieving data from my calendar in a secure manner. Furthermore, this display is
                battery-powered. In order to make the display last for multiple months on a single charge, the program
                has to be very energy efficient.
